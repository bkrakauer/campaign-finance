# Democracy Dollars: An Investigation of the Influence of Money in Congress

## Introduction
This project is an attempt to make use of campaign finance data to generate insights about the ideology and voting behavior of membes of Congress. I used data from campaign contributions (both from individuals and from committees) to cluster candidates into groups based on the similarity of their sources and amounts of campaign contributions, and determine whether membership in these groups determine anything about voting behavior. I then developed graphs of politicians and donors to determine whether we can determine anything about their behavior from these networks.
